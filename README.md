A NodeJS project for scraping and displaying information about historical trees in Sydney

The _City Of Sydney_ website has a section dedicated to presenting information on "Significant Trees" in Sydney. The data is stored using a WordPress store locator plugin, and written to the page in one big javascript file.

I wanted to find a way to retrieve this information, store it, and then present it in a more attractive format, and perhaps add better filtering functionality / navigation on mobile devices.

I also wanted a small side-project to learn some NodeJS, and to do something with maps.
